# DataBindingExample

A Simple App Example using DataBinding: Binding Adapters, LiveData-MutableLiveData.
The app shows a card with informatiÃ³n of a product like title, price, description, stock and a buy button. When we click the button, stock decrease, when is > 25 the app considers a high stock and draws one green icon, when stock is > 10 that icon is yellow, if stock is < 10 the icon is red, finally if stock = 0 the title and the price are crossed out by a line.
This concept may be implemented in an app with petitions to an API REST and RecyclerViews
